<h1>Best Movies According to Deb</h1>
<h2>My top three movie recommendations</h2>
<hr />
<h3>French Kiss</h3>
<p>French Kiss is my favorite movie because the jokes are extremely funny, the characters are very likable, and Meg Ryan can't be beat.</p>
<h3>Far From the Maddening Crowd</h3>
<p>Far From the Maddening Crowd is a perfect movie is you really want a story to follow.  I love a movie that can stand on the story line instead of special effects. This love story takes a winding road to happiness.</p>
<h3>Third Movie Here</h3>
<p>I am having a really hard time deciding on a third movie. My list of favorites changes so often depending on my mood. This would probably be a musical or a cheesy chick flick.</p>
